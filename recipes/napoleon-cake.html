        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Have you ever heard of Napoleon Cake?
            If not, you have been missing out!
            I've had this cake since I was a child,
            and it's still one of my favorite cakes
            that I've ever had. I found
            <a href="https://letthebakingbegin.com/best-napoleon-cake-ever/">this</a>
            recipe that I think sounds delicious.
        </p>
        <p>It is composed of many thin layers, which in
            the Russian version of the cake, are kept soft and
            easily scoopable. Between each layer is sweet cream which
            sometimes reminds me of creme brulee.

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ul>
            <h4>Making the puff pastry:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Measure out all of the ingredients for the puff pastry and get your tools and utensils ready.</li>

                <li>Mix 2/3 cup cold water, 1 Tbsp vinegar & 3 Tbsp vodka (replace with water if not using) in a cup.
                </li>

                <li>In a separate cup whisk together 2 eggs and a 1/8 tsp salt. Combine mixtures of two cups and stir to
                    combine.</li>

                <li>By food processor: Add 5 cups flour to the cup of your food processor. Now add 3 ½ sticks cold,
                    cubed
                    butter, and pulse or process until the crumbs are pea-size.</li>

                <li>By hand: Alternatively, pour the flour onto the cutting board, then add cold, cubed butter, and
                    using a
                    long, sharp knife keep cutting and mixing the mixture until the pieces are pea-size.</li>

                <li>Add wet to dry: Add the liquid ingredients and continue pulsing or mixing until the dough starts
                    sticking to itself a bit, but is not formed yet.</li>

                <li>Form into a dough: Pour the content of the food processor bowl onto a work surface and start
                    gathering
                    and pressing the dough together with your hands, trying to work it as little as possible. Form a
                    ball
                    and
                    knead it for a couple of seconds until a dough forms.</li>

                <li>Shape & Divide: Shape the dough into a log and then cut it into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece
                    into a
                    ball, cover, and refrigerate for about an hour to allow the liquid to hydrate the flour. This will
                    also
                    make it easier to roll the dough out later.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
