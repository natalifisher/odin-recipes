        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Have you ever heard of kateli?
            It's the Russian version of meatballs, 
            but even more rich in flavor and is usually composed
            of pork and turkey.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many varieties for the recipe, 
            but one of the most important ingredients
            is onion. Cooked onion gives the meatballs
            a very rich taste that is otherwise hard 
            to replicate.
        </p>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Grate 1 onion and chop 2 Tbsp of parsley.</li>

            <li>Use Kitchen Aid Mixer bowl to combine meat,
                1/2 cup of bread crumbs, spices(1/2 tsp salt,
                1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp ground pepper), 
                1  egg,  1 Tbsp of mayo, onion and parsley. 
                Mix everything well on a lower speed setting (#3),
                or combine ingredients by hand if no mixer is available.
            </li>

            <li>Form patties using ice cream scoop to make even portions.
                    Makes approx. 20 patties. (don't try to flatten them once 
                    they are on the skillet or juices will seep out).</li>

            <li>Heat about 4 Tbsp of olive oil over medium/high heat and saute
                    the patties (adding more oil if necessary) until browned 
                    on both sides ( approx. 3 min on per site), flipping twice
                    so they don’t burn. At the same time preheat your oven to 400°F</li>

            <li> Remove patties of the skillet and place them in a glass baking 
                dish. Cover dish with foil and bake for 10 minutes. Yum!</li>
