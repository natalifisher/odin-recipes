Hi!

This is a rather straightforward project where I interact and use common components of
html. Things like linking to outside webpages, having some navigation links, and providing
relevant images are a part of this project. I also went a bit beyond the guidelines 
for the project by adding a background picture, as well as styling for the page headers and bodies. 
I provide information for three recipes: A starter (potato salad), dinner (meatballs), and the
most important part (in my opinion), the desser (Napoleon cake). 

Please note that the recipes are not mine, and a link to each source is provided at the bottom
of each respective recipe page. 

Enjoy!
